    "## Understanding Data Updates and the Importance of Real-Time Access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Update Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "The NOAA GOES16 satellite transmits data continuously, covering a wide range of atmospheric and environmental conditions across the Western Hemisphere. This data is crucial for meteorology and climate monitoring. It includes high-resolution imagery and other meteorological parameters that are updated every few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from the GOES16 satellite is captured and then pushed to AWS in near real-time, allowing users to access updated information without significant delays. This real-time stream ensures that every new piece of data—be it cloud patterns, storm developments, or atmospheric changes—is made available to users as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Real-Time Access Is Crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weather Forecasting and Alerts**: Real-time data access is critical for weather forecasting. Meteorologists rely on up-to-the-minute data to predict severe weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, which can save lives and property by providing timely warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Research and Environmental Monitoring**: Scientists studying climate patterns, atmospheric science, and environmental changes depend on the most current data to ensure the accuracy of their work. Delays in data access can affect the relevance and effectiveness of scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Commercial Applications**: Industries such as agriculture, aviation, and maritime operations rely heavily on accurate weather forecasts which depend on real-time data. For instance, farmers need timely weather information to plan irrigation and harvesting, while airlines use real-time weather data to route flights safely and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Public Safety and Emergency Response**: During natural disasters, real-time satellite data can guide evacuation plans and emergency responses, providing updated information on disaster progression and affected areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Users Access This Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To access this real-time data, users can connect to AWS where the data is stored in S3 buckets. The data is organized and can be accessed publicly or with authenticated sessions depending on the data's sensitivity and intended usage. This setup allows users from around the world to download and utilize the data for a variety of applications seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of services like AWS ensures scalability and reliability in data delivery, which is vital for maintaining continuous access to satellite data for global users.\n",

    "## Running the Real-Time Data Updater\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss how we automate the process of fetching and updating real-time satellite data from NOAA GOES16 using a background process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of `run_updater()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_updater()` function is a crucial part of our notebook's capability to access and process real-time data. This function is designed to run continuously in the background, checking for new satellite data updates and loading them into our analysis environment as soon as they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_updater()` function is part of a Python package called `real_time_package`, specifically within the `runner` module. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Background Thread**: The function initiates a background thread that runs independently of the main notebook execution. This allows the notebook to remain responsive and capable of performing other tasks while data updates are being managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Checking**: The background thread periodically checks for new data files in the NOAA GOES16 AWS S3 bucket. It uses predefined criteria to determine which files are new since the last check.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Loading**: Once new files are detected, the function automatically loads them into the current session, ensuring that the dataset in use is always up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: It includes robust error handling mechanisms to manage issues like network interruptions or access errors, ensuring the process is reliable and the notebook environment remains stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from real_time_package.runner import run_updater\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the data updater in the background\n",
    "run_updater()\n"

    "### Creation of Composite Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite variables are synthesized views created from multiple individual data channels, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the observed scenes. Here’s how Satpy creates these composites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combining Channels**: Satpy combines data from multiple channels based on predefined or custom algorithms. For example, a true-color image composite uses red, green, and blue spectral data to create a representation similar to what the human eye would see.\n",
    "2. **Enhancements**: After combining the channels, Satpy applies enhancements to improve the visual contrast and color of the composite images. These enhancements might include adjusting brightness, contrast, and color curves to make certain features more distinguishable.\n",
    "3. **Mapping**: The data is often reprojected onto a standard map projection for easy integration and comparison with other geospatial data, facilitating uses in weather forecasting, research, and decision support systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: True Color Composite\n",
    "\n",
    "A common composite created by Satpy is the \"True Color\" image, which simulates natural coloration of the Earth as seen from space. It uses data from the red, green, and blue visible light channels. Here’s a simple example of how to create this composite in Satpy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the necessary channels\n",
    "channels = ['C01', 'C02', 'C03']  # These channel names may vary based on the satellite\n",
    "scn.load(channels)\n",
